# Web-programming. Learning git.

---

## Yo!

After taking the suggested Git course, I learned how to create and merge branches. I also learned the difference between 'cherry-pick' and 'rebase' commands. With a great interactive display of Git's work, the material has become much more accessible and easy to understand. In general, I liked getting new knowledge that will definitely come in handy.

## Hi there 🫡

I`m Kuruliak Eduard. My emotions after taking this course are quite mixed. You definitely need to know this, but still, the commands in the console are not very convenient. It is easier and faster to use the IDE functionality

## Hi!

I am Artem Karachevtsev.
Greetings to all!

## Hello!

After completing the course on git commands, I've learnt a lot of commands that I didn't even know existed before: rebase, checkout, options of push, pull, and fetch. So this course was really useful, and I enjoyed it, even though it took a lot of time. Actually, all commands are useful, so, I think, sooner or later I'll use them all

## Hi!

When I finished this course I understood many Git features. I've discovered a lot of git commands and I think that it will help me in the future. Also I've got to know how to use GitHub and I find it very useful and interesting. I want to improve my skills and hope that in the future I would be able to use them all!

## Wassup!

I'm Biliakov Artem, CHnU student on my second year. And this is a message for the first lab on web-programming. Git is kinda cool, it's very functional and versatile. Overall I've liked learning more about it. And I think I'll use it at full potential someday.

As I have the right to write whatever I want, I'll leave my steam account page here, in case you want to play with someone. https://steamcommunity.com/id/BeliyDot/
I may not answer immediately, I can be busy, but maybe we can play one day.

That's all. Cya, sigmas.

Git is definition of source safety.
If you have very skillful approaches with git reset --hard, then git reflog will calm your nerves (probably).
I also suggest you to listen to my music i write from time to time : https://www.tumblr.com/justeno
